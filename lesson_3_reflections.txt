When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing your project with other people, or when working on a remote computer where you don't have the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Should this be push? Control over which branches are pulled for an update. If pushing,
it would prevent items from being publicly accessible before you are finished
working on them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork = copy of repository from GH to GH
Clone = copy of repository from GH to local or local to local
Branches = separate editing track from master or branch
Fork to get copy of someone else's repository with credit back to them, stays on GH. Clone to work
on a repository locally or make a duplicate of one locally. Branch to test new edits or features
before possibly committing them to the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You have up-to-date files which you can access even while offline. You can compare them to your
working copy and merge components if and when you want.
