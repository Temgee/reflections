When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing your project with other people, or when working on a remote computer where you don't have the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Should this be push? Control over which branches are pulled for an update. If pushing,
it would prevent items from being publicly accessible before you are finished
working on them.
