What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A git config folder is added at the current location. Git needs to know what files
belong to the new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging only holds files slated for commit vs holding all the files. It allows you
to commit one or more files separately from files you are still editing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only add the files belonging to the change to staging, If necessary, you can can do a diff to check what edits your are commiting against the previous last commit.
